Hello $userFirstName,

As part of usual security monitoring activities for $businessName, the Cyber Fusion Center alerts on instances where users have configured their mailbox to automatically forward mail outside of $businessName.  

Your account was indicated as being configured to forward mail externally to the following address: 
 
$smtpForwardingAddress


Forwarding email outside of $businessName in this way breaches the $businessName Email Standard, and the $businessName End User Acceptable Use Policy, which can be found here: 
•	<policy link 1>
•	<policy link 2>

In particular the $businessName Email standard states: 
•	<excerpt 1>
•	<excerpt 2>
•	<excerpt 3>

The $businessName End User Acceptable Use Policy also states: 
•	<excerpt 1>
•	<excerpt 2>

As a result, the Cyber Fusion Center have deleted this automatic forwarding rule, and it will no longer work as intended. 

Please refrain from these activities in the future. 

Regards,

$businessName Cyber Fusion Center
