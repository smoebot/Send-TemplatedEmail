Hello $userFirstName,

As part of usual security monitoring activities for $businessName, the Cyber Fusion Center Team alerts on instances where users have created mail forwarding rules that automatically forward mail outside of $businessName. 

Your account has been indicated as having an automatic forwarding rule created. The rule is included below:


$ruleSnip


Forwarding email outside of $businessName in this way breaches the $businessName Email Standard, and the $businessName End User Acceptable Use Policy, which can be found here: 
*  <policy link 1>
*  <policy link 1>

In particular the $businessName Email standard states: 
*  <excerpt 1>
*  <excerpt 2>
*  <excerpt 3>

The $businessName End User Acceptable Use Policy also states: 
*  <excerpt 1>
*  <excerpt 2>

As a result, the Cyber Fusion Center Team have deleted this automatic forwarding rule along with any other rules that forward email externally to $businessName.
Mailbox rules identified by this process will no longer work as intended. 

Please refrain from these activities in the future. 

Regards,

$businessName Cyber Fusion Center Team
